- The **XGBoost** model outperformed other approaches with the highest **Sharpe Ratio of 1.12**.
- Even a small increase in accuracy (**57.4% vs ~50%**) leads to **significant outperformance** when applied to trading strategies.
- **Random predictions** perform near-zero Sharpe, emphasizing that our model adds **real predictive value**.

    st.markdown("""
    In financial markets, the goal is not just to be right more often, but to be **right when it matters** â€”
    during volatile or high-return periods. **Sharpe Ratio** captures the **risk-adjusted return**, reflecting
    how consistent and profitable a strategy is.

    A model with 57% accuracy but good Sharpe is more valuable than one with 60% accuracy and poor return consistency.
